<h1 style="text-align: center;">Call For Submissions</h1>

The significant advances in computational and data science over the past decade have had an immense impact on biomedical science and healthcare. Concurrently, researchers in the biomedical fields now face new challenges caused mainly by the nature of complex, often high-dimensional, noisy, and diverse datasets.

Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in the role topology plays in machine learning and data science. Topology offers a collection of techniques that have matured into a field known as **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)**. TDA provides a robust set of general-purpose tools that have demonstrated strong performance in numerous real-world applications. These tools are naturally applicable to various data types including:

- Images  
- Point clouds  
- Graphs and meshes  
- Time-varying data  

TDA techniques are increasingly being integrated with deep learning to improve performance, expressiveness, and generalizability. Their robustness allows for the discovery of complex relationships and extraction of persistent features across multiple scales, even in noisy environments. Moreover, TDA naturally supports **interpretability and visualization**, helping to build trust in AI systems among medical professionals.

All these qualities strongly motivate the use of TDA in areas such as **neuroscience, bioscience, biomedicine**, and **medical imaging**.

### Workshop Scope

This workshop focuses on leveraging TDA to enhance the **performance, generalizability, expressiveness, efficiency**, and **explainability** of modern medical data analysis methods. Specifically, it emphasizes TDA alone or in combination with other computational techniques (e.g., deep learning, feature engineering) across modalities like:

- Medical images and videos  
- Sound and physiological signals  
- Text and sequential data  

The workshop aims to foster collaboration among **mathematicians, biomedical engineers, computer scientists, statisticians,** and **medical professionals**, encouraging knowledge exchange and showcasing the value of TDA in medical data analysis.

### Topics of Interest

We welcome submissions exploring the use of TDA—alone or combined with other computational techniques—in solving problems in medical computing and computer-assisted intervention. Topics include but are not limited to:

1. Ensemble methods combining topology and deep learning  
2. Topological approaches for disease diagnosis, monitoring, and prediction  
3. TDA-based classification and segmentation (e.g., level sets, graph cuts)  
4. Topological techniques for medical signal processing (e.g., image, audio, text)  
5. Personalized medicine using TDA  
6. Shape modeling and analysis for medical data  
7. Optimization and learning strategies grounded in topology  
8. TDA for data registration, summarization, and enhancement  
9. Visualization, interpretability, and explainability of medical data  
10. Scalable TDA methods for electronic health records  
11. Topological structures in biomedical data analysis

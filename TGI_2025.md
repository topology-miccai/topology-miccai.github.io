The significant advances in computational and data science over the past decade have had an immense impact on biomedical science and healthcare. Concurrently, researchers in the biomedical fields now face new challenges caused mainly by the nature of complex, often high-dimensional, noisy and diverse datasets.

Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in the role topology plays in machine learning and data science. Topology offers a collection of topology-based techniques that have matured to a field known today as Topological Data Analysis (TDA). TDA provides a general and multi-purpose set of robust tools that have shown excellent performance in several real-world applications. These tools are naturally applicable to numerous types of data including images, points cloud, graphs, meshes, time-varying data and more. TDA techniques have been increasingly used with other techniques such as deep learning to enhance the performance, expressiveness, and generalizability of generic learning tasks. Furthermore, the properties of the topological tools allow discovering complex relationships and separating signals that are hidden in the data due to noise. In addition, TDA has an immense ability to extract unique features that are persistent over multiple scales. Finally, topological representations naturally lend themselves to insightful visualization making them useful for tasks that require interpretability and explainability. In particular, TDA tools can offer insights and interpretability on the data that are not readily available in main-stream computational tools such as deep learning techniques. The interpretation and explainability properties of TDA could help enhance the trust of medical professionals in intelligent systems.

All these properties of topological-based methods strongly motivate the adoption of TDA tools to various applications and domains including neuroscience, bioscience, biomedicine, and medical imaging.

This workshop will focus on using TDA techniques to enhance the performance, generalizability, expressiveness, efficiency, and explainability of the current methods applied to medical data. In particular, the workshop will focus on using TDA tools solely or combined with other computational techniques (e.g., feature engineering and deep learning) to analyze medical data including images/videos, sounds, physiological, texts and sequence data. The combination of TDA and other computational approaches is more effective in summarizing, analyzing, quantifying, and visualizing complex medical data.

This workshop will bring together mathematicians, biomedical engineers, computer scientists, statisticians and medical doctors for the purpose of showing the strength of using TDA-based tools for medical data analysis. It will also expose current applications, and provide an interdisciplinary forum for the exchange of ideas on novel applications, current challenges, and future directions.

We welcome submissions that present how TDA techniques, slowly or combined with other computational techniques, have been, or potentially could be, employed to tackle interesting problems in several areas of medical data computing and computer-assisted intervention. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

1. Ensemble of topological and deep learning models for medical applications

2. Topological-based approaches for disease diagnosis, monitoring, and prediction

3. Topological-based approaches for classification and segmentation (e.g., level sets, graph cuts and fuzzy connectedness)

4. Topological-based approaches for medical signal processing (e.g., images, audio, texts, etc.)

5. Topological-based approaches for personalized medicine

6. Shape models and analysis for medical data

7. Topological-based learning and optimizations for medical applications

8. Topological-based medical data registration, summarization, and enhancement

9. Explainability, interpretability, and visualization of medical data

10. Scalable TDA methods for medical records

11. Topological structures for the analysis of biomedical data
